Passionate about `Open Source` and `Product Development`.

Over the years I have gained a broad range of knowledge in fields such as `robotics`, `product design and development`, and `artificial intelligence`.

I took part to diverse project‑oriented competitions which resulted in excellent results, showcasing my ability to think critically and apply my knowledge to solve real‑world problems.
