Passionate about `Open Source` and `Product Development`.

Over the years I have gained a broad range of knowledge in fields such as `robotics`, `hardware development`, `optimal control` algorithms and `artificial intelligence`.

I took part to diverse projectâ€‘oriented competitions which resulted in excellent results, keeping in contact with many companies and applying my expertise to solve real study cases.
